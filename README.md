# Genetic Algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

This project implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).

## Description

The TSP is a classic algorithmic problem in the field of computer science that focuses on optimization. In this project, a GA is used to find an efficient solution to the problem. 

The GA makes use of various operations such as selection (tournament selection), crossover (order-based crossover), and mutation (swap mutation) to produce new generations of solutions. The fitness of a solution is measured as the inverse of the total distance of the route.

The project includes an analysis of the effect of various parameters on the performance of the GA. These parameters include mutation rate, population size, and elite size. The project also explores the stochastic behavior of the GA.

## Results

The GA was able to find good solutions to the TSP. However, due to the nature of the GA, the solution may not always be the absolute best solution, but it is a good approximation. The performance of the GA is heavily influenced by the parameters used, such as the mutation rate, population size, and elite size.
